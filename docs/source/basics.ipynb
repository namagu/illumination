Here's a first step toward that capability; it still needs a bit of work, but hopefully this is enough to get started. The basic idea is to create an available plot location (an `Axes` object, in `matplotlib`-speak), where you can fill later with whatever plot elements you like. The below example demonstrates how to populate the time-series frame in two ways, both using its built-in `.plot` function and simply by adding elements to `i.frames['timeseries'].ax`."
